  "welcom page part 1": "GraphQL is a powerful tool for exploring and testing GraphQL APIs. With an intuitive interface and powerful features, it`s the perfect solution for developers looking to streamline their GraphQL development workflow.",
  "welcom page part 2": "The goal of this project was to develop a powerful GraphQL playground that would help developers explore and test GraphQL APIs more efficiently. Our team of 3 developers worked to create an app that would meet the needs of developers of all skill levels.",
  "welcom page part 3": "This app was developed as a project for the RS School course name, which is an online course designed to teach students the skills they need to become professional developers. As part of the course, students are required to complete a series of projects that demonstrate their understanding of the concepts covered in the course.",
  "welcom page part 4": "Our GraphQL playground app leverages the power of the GraphQL API provided by rickandmortyapi.com/graphql. This API is specifically designed to retrieve information about the popular animated series 'Rick and Morty'. It offers a wide range of queries to fetch data related to characters, episodes, locations, and more. In our app, we have integrated this GraphQL API as the sole endpoint for developers to explore and test their GraphQL queries. Although the app doesn't provide the functionality to switch to different endpoints, it offers a comprehensive set of features to interact with the rickandmortyapi.com/graphql API efficiently.",
